            <p class id="text">Hi! I am Jack Sorensen. I enjoy cooking for my family, playing board
                and video games, and spending time with my pets. I was born and raised
                in the Seattle area, and live about an hour north of Seattle in a town
                called Granite Falls with my wife Christine. My favorite color is indigo,
                I am left handed, I am a pretty amazing thumb wrestler, and I can show you how
                to bake bacon better than you could ever fry it! That's why its called bacon
                after all. Bake-on.
