Hello and welcome to Jack's Readme!
This is my first iteration of my portfolio website. while i used all the guidelines provided in the homework to emulate the examples, i went a slightly different route. I wanted to demonstrate that i am starting to pick up a lot of the features we are going over in class. I did my best to follow the guidelines provided while also creating everything from scratch. Aside from page to page copy/paste to save time, all of the html and css were typed from scratch!

The page itself isnt super flashy, but I am proud that i went with no real experience in the field to a working website in 4 days. 

IF there are any questions, please contact me via smoke signals.

Just kidding. Jack.sorensen11@gmail.com
